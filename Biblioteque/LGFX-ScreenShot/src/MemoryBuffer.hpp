/**
 * @class MemoryBuffer
 * @brief A class that handles memory allocation and deallocation for a buffer.
 *
 * This class provides an RAII approach to manage a dynamically allocated buffer. It ensures that memory is
 * allocated during object creation and automatically freed when the object goes out of scope.
 *
 * @note It is recommended to use the `MemoryBuffer` class when dealing with dynamic memory allocation,
 *       to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper memory management.
 *
 * Example use:
 * ```cpp
 * {
 *     MemoryBuffer buffer(512);
 *     if (buffer.isAllocated()) { // Check if allocated!
 *         // Access buffer here...
 *     } else {
 *         // Handle error (e.g., log error, retry later)
 *     }
 * } // buffer automatically freed
 *
 * ```
